### A personal website, by Oscar Yu

Just a fun little side project to teach myself HTML, CSS, and JS.

Logo drawn in Paint Tool SAI, vectorized using shape tracer in Illustrator and animated using <a href="https://github.com/metafizzy/zdog">vivus</a>.

Animated/Interactive icons for redirects created by me and implemented using <a href="https://github.com/metafizzy/zdog">Zdog</a>.

All other effects and website elements coded directly in HTML and CSS.
