# 1845. Seat Reservation Manager

## Meta
Date: 06/11/23

Difficulty: Medium

## Intuition
- Need to keep track of smallest unreserved seat
- Minheap is perfect; `O(log n)` insertion/removal, `O(1)` access for smallest value

## Solution
```py
class SeatManager:

    def __init__(self, n: int):
        self.minHeap = []
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            heapq.heappush(self.minHeap, i)

    def reserve(self) -> int:
        return heapq.heappop(self.minHeap)

    def unreserve(self, seatNumber: int) -> None:
        heapq.heappush(self.minHeap, seatNumber)
```
