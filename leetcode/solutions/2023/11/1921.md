# 1921. Eliminate Maximum Number of Monsters

## Meta
Date: 07/11/23

Difficulty: Medium

## Intution
- Shoot monsters in order of how close they are to the city (in time units, not distance)
- Calculate time units, then sort
- Iterate through monsters; incrementing time until all monsters are dead OR time exceeds time needed for monster to reach the city

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def eliminateMaximum(self, dist: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
        # Calculate time units until they reach the city (round up), then sort
        turns = [((dist[i] - 1) // speed[i]) + 1 for i in range(len(dist))]
        turns.sort(reverse = True)

        numEliminated = 0

        for time in range(1, len(dist) + 1):
            if time > turns[-1]:
                return numEliminated
            else:
                turns.pop()
                numEliminated += 1
        
        return numEliminated
```
