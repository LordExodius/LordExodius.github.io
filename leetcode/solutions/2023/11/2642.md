# 2642. Design Graph With Shortest Path Calculator

## Meta
Date: 10/11/23

Difficulty: Hard

## Intuition
- Keep track of all edges and minimum costs from node to node
- If you keep track in **reverse order**, you can add all new paths whenever a new edge is added
- Also, the min cost from each node `n` to the new connection `(from, to, cost)` is simply `minCost(n -> from) + cost`

## Solution
```py
```
