# 1759. Count Number of Homogenous Substrings

## Meta
Date: 09/11/23

Difficulty: Medium

## Intution
- Each homogenous substring (HS) is the sum of its substrings
- I.e., HS of length 4 contains:
    - 4 HS length 1
    - 3 HS length 2
    - 2 HS length 3
    - 1 HS length 4
- Thus, the total number of HS in a HS of length 4 is `4 + 3 + 2 + 1`
- Since we're accumlating character as we parse the string, simply add the length of the current HS to the counter.
    - Example: `aaabbcaa`
    - I.e., `1(a) + 2(aa) + 3(aaa) + 1(b) + 2(bb) + 1(c) + 1(a) + 2(aa)`
    - `= 13`
- Restart from 1 if a new letter is encountered

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def countHomogenous(self, s: str) -> int:
        homo = 0
        prevChar = None
        prevLen = 1

        mod = (10**9) + 7

        for char in s:
            if char == prevChar:
                prevLen += 1
            else:
                prevChar = char
                prevLen = 1
            homo += prevLen
        
        return homo % mod
```
