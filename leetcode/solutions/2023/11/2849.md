# 2849. Determine if a Cell Is Reachable at a Given Time

## Meta
Date: 08/11/23

Difficulty: Medium

## Intuition
- Since you can move diagonally, the minimum time required is the longest of `x` or `y` distance
- Because you can visit cells more than once, you can arbitrarily add time
- Thus, the only cases where you cannot make it is if the min time is > `t`
    - OR, if you start on the finish and you must move 1 unit

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def isReachableAtTime(self, sx: int, sy: int, fx: int, fy: int, t: int) -> bool:
        if sx == fx and sy == fy and t == 1: return False
        return t >= max(abs(fy - sy), abs(fx - sx))
```
