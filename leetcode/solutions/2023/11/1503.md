# 1503. Last Moment Before All Ants Fall Out of a Plank

## Meta
Date: 04/11/23

Difficulty: Medium

## Intuition
- If ants all facing same way; longest time = furthest ant
- The bouncing is confusing; let's see what it actually does to the ants:
- What happens
    - Let `L` be an ant moving left and `R` be an ant moving right;
    - If `L` is at pos 3 and `R` is at pos 1, they will meet at pos 2, switching directions
    - One time unit later, the ant moving `Left` is now at position 1 and the ant moving `Right` is now at position 3
    - They have simply swapped places, and it looks like they phased through each other

- tl;dr - bouncing is fake

```
t = 0 

_ > _ < _ _ _
```
```
t = 1 

    >
_ _ < _ _ _ _
```
```
t = 3 

_ < _ > _ _ _
```

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def getLastMoment(self, n: int, left: List[int], right: List[int]) -> int:
        # Furthest ant moving left from left edge
        maxLeft = max(left) if left else 0 

        # Furthest ant moving right from right edge
        maxRight = n - min(right) if right else 0 

        # Ant with longest distance from their target edge
        return max(maxLeft, maxRight) 
```
