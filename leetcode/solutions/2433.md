#### Intution + Prerequisites
- Understand how `XOR` works
    - Associative + Commutative
    - Property: `a ^ b = c`, then `a ^ c = b` and `b ^ c = a`

#### English
Since `pref[i]` is the XOR of every element from `0` to `i` in `arr` and we know that `XOR` is associative, `pref[i] = pref[i-1] ^ arr[i]`.

`XOR` has an interesting property where for some `a^b=c`, we can rearrange any of the variables and have the equation still hold. Thus, to get `arr[i]`, we can rearrange `pref[i] = pref[i-1] ^ arr[i]` into `arr[i] = pref[i-1] ^ pref[i]`.

Example 2 gives us what happens if there is only one element in `pref`: it is identical to the only element in `arr`.

The solution will simply loop through `pref` starting at index 1, applying `pref[i-1] ^ pref[i]` to generate `arr[i]` (The code has it reversed, but `XOR` is commutative so the solution is not affected).

#### Solution
```py
def findArray(pref: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    arr = [pref[0]]
    for ind in range(1, len(pref)):
        arr.append(pref[ind] ^ pref[ind-1])
    return arr
```
